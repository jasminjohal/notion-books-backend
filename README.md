# Notion Random Book Generator (Backend)

I have a database of books in my Notion workspace named `Reading Log`. It contains all the books I've read, the books I'm currently reading, and the books on my "TBR" (To Be Read) list. My TBR list is quite extensive so it's overwhelming to pick a book to read. I developed a random book generation application to address this problem. This is the backend for the application. It supports GET requests for three endpoints:

- `/random-tbr-book`
- `/random-tbr-book/:genre`
- `/tbr-genres`

## Get a Random Unread Book

Returns a random book with the status `To Read` in my `Reading Log` database in Notion.

```
GET /random-tbr-book
```
